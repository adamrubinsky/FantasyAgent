## Strategic Implications for SUPERFLEX

1. **QB Scoring**: Lower passing yards points (0.04 vs 0.06) and lower TD points (4 vs 6) makes QBs slightly LESS valuable than typical SUPERFLEX
2. **WR Premium**: Need 3 starting WRs + FLEX eligibility = HIGH WR demand
3. **Kicker Strategy**: Bonus points for long FGs and penalties for misses make kicker selection more important
4. **Fumble Penalty**: -2 for fumbles makes ball security more valuable

## Draft Strategy Priorities
1. **WR Depth Critical**: Need 4-5 WRs minimum (3 starters + FLEX + depth)
2. **QB Value Moderated**: Still valuable for SUPERFLEX but not as premium due to lower scoring
3. **Late-Round Kicker**: Target accurate long-range kickers
4. **Ball Security**: Prioritize players with low fumble rates
