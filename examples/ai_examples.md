Here are examples of what the AI assistant can do once you have a Claude API key:

## Natural Language Questions

```bash
python3 main.py ask "Should I draft Josh Allen in round 1?"
```

**Expected AI Response:**
```
üéØ AI Analysis:

**YES, Josh Allen is an excellent first-round pick in SUPERFLEX leagues.**

Here's why Allen makes sense at pick #1 for your Founding Father Keeper League:

1. **SUPERFLEX Premium**: In your league format with 2 QB spots, elite QBs like Allen provide massive positional advantage. He's consistently been a top-3 fantasy QB with 385+ point upside.

2. **Dual-Threat Ceiling**: Allen's rushing ability (650+ yards, 8 TDs projected) gives him one of the highest floors and ceilings at the position. His 32 passing TDs + rushing production creates a huge scoring differential.

3. **Positional Scarcity**: With only 24 starting QB spots across 12 teams in your league, locking in a QB1 early is crucial. The dropoff from Allen/Jackson/Mahomes to the next tier is significant.

**Recommendation**: Take Allen confidently in round 1. In SUPERFLEX, elite QBs are as valuable as top RBs, and Allen has the safest floor with elite ceiling among all QBs.

## Player Comparisons

```bash
python3 main.py compare "Josh Allen" "Lamar Jackson"
```

**Expected AI Response:**
```
‚öñÔ∏è Player Comparison: Josh Allen vs Lamar Jackson

**RECOMMENDATION: Josh Allen by a narrow margin**

**Key Factors:**
- **Passing Volume**: Allen (4,200 yards, 32 TDs) vs Jackson (3,800 yards, 28 TDs)
- **Rushing Floor**: Jackson (820 rushing yards) vs Allen (650 rushing yards)  
- **Injury Risk**: Jackson has more injury concerns, Allen more durable recently
- **ADP Value**: Both going in top 3 picks, minimal difference

**Analysis:**
Allen gets the slight edge due to his superior passing production and recent durability. While Jackson has a higher rushing floor, Allen's arm strength and red zone usage give him more weekly ceiling. In your Half-PPR format, both are elite options.

Jackson offers slightly more boom weeks due to rushing upside, but Allen provides more consistent weekly production. For risk-averse drafters, Allen is the safer pick. For ceiling chasers, Jackson has higher explosive potential.

**Verdict**: You can't go wrong with either. If forced to choose, Allen's passing volume and durability give him a microscopic edge, but draft the one you prefer watching play.

## Draft Recommendations

```bash  
python3 main.py recommend -p 37
```

**Expected AI Response:**
```
üéØ AI Draft Recommendation for Pick #37:

**PRIMARY RECOMMENDATION: Target WR depth or secure QB2**

Based on your Founding Father Keeper League settings (12-team, Half-PPR, SUPERFLEX), here's your strategy for pick #37 (Round 4):

**Top Options:**
1. **WR Tier Break**: Players like DK Metcalf, Mike Evans, or Stefon Diggs if available - WR is your most scarce position (0.28 per team)
2. **QB2 Insurance**: Dak Prescott, Tua Tagovailoa if you don't have your second starting QB yet
3. **RB Value**: If a player like Najee Harris or Aaron Jones fell, grab the value

**Strategy Notes:**
- Your league heavily favors WRs due to roster construction (2 WR + FLEX + SUPERFLEX)
- QB2 becomes urgent by round 6-7, so consider grabbing one soon
- Avoid TEs unless Travis Kelce somehow fell - you can wait until round 8+

**Alternative Scenarios:**
If top WRs are gone, pivot to QB2 or best available RB. Don't reach for need - value should drive picks in rounds 3-5.

**Next Pick Planning**: Target the position you didn't fill here in round 5, maintaining roster balance while hitting value.

## Conversational Interface (Future Web Version)

When deployed to AgentCore with a web interface, conversations will flow naturally:

```
User: "I'm torn between Bijan Robinson and CeeDee Lamb at pick 8"

AI: "Great question! In your SUPERFLEX league, I'd lean CeeDee Lamb here. 

WRs are actually your most scarce position (0.28 per team vs 0.20 for RBs), and Lamb's target share with Dak makes him incredibly reliable in Half-PPR. Bijan is talented but the Falcons' offense has question marks.

Would you like me to analyze the rest of your draft strategy if you take Lamb here?"

User: "Yes, and what about QB strategy?"

AI: "Perfect! If you take Lamb at #8, here's your QB roadmap:

Since you passed on the elite tier (Allen/Jackson/Mahomes likely gone), target your QB1 in rounds 3-4. Players like Dak Prescott or Anthony Richardson offer great value there.

Your QB2 window is rounds 6-8 - don't wait too long or you'll be stuck with backup QBs in a SUPERFLEX league.

Should I walk through some specific scenarios for rounds 2-3?"
```
