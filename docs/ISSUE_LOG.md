## August 5, 2025

### Issue #1: Roster ID Assignment Bug
**Severity**: üî¥ Critical  
**Component**: `core/draft_monitor.py`  
**Discovered**: During initial draft monitoring testing

**Problem**: 
- Draft monitor was assigning user to roster ID 1 instead of actual roster ID 7
- Caused incorrect roster tracking and recommendations

**Root Cause**:
- Hardcoded roster assignment logic not matching user's actual draft position

**Solution**:
```python
# Fixed roster ID detection logic to use actual user roster position
user_roster_id = self.get_user_roster_id()  # Now correctly returns 7
```

**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED

### Issue #2: Async Slicing Bug
**Severity**: üü° Medium  
**Component**: `agents/draft_crew.py`  
**Discovered**: When fetching available players

**Problem**:
- Code was attempting to slice a coroutine before awaiting it
- `get_available_players()[:30]` failed because function returns a coroutine

**Root Cause**:
- Attempting to slice before await resolution

**Solution**:
```python
# Before (broken):
available = self.get_available_players()[:30]

# After (fixed):
available = await self.get_available_players()
available = available[:30]
```

**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED

### Issue #3: WebSocket Connection Instability
**Severity**: üü° Medium  
**Component**: `web_app.py`  
**Discovered**: During extended testing sessions

**Problem**:
- WebSocket connections dropping unexpectedly
- No automatic reconnection logic

**Root Cause**:
- Missing error handling and reconnection logic

**Solution**:
- Added comprehensive try/catch blocks
- Implemented automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- Added connection status indicators in UI

**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED

## November 8, 2024 (Day 5)

### Issue #4: FantasyPros API Parameter Case Sensitivity
**Severity**: üü° Medium  
**Component**: `core/official_fantasypros.py`  
**Discovered**: When fetching rankings

**Problem**:
- API returning 400 errors with lowercase parameters
- Parameters like 'draft', 'half' not working

**Root Cause**:
- FantasyPros API requires uppercase parameters

**Solution**:
```python
# All parameters must be uppercase
params = {
    'position': 'ALL',    # Not 'all'
    'scoring': 'HALF',    # Not 'half' 
    'type': 'DRAFT',      # Not 'draft'
    'week': 0
}
```

**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED

### Issue #5: Sleeper search_rank Misconception
**Severity**: üî¥ Critical  
**Component**: `api/sleeper_client.py`  
**Discovered**: When analyzing player rankings

**Problem**:
- Sleeper's `search_rank` field being used as fantasy ranking
- Tyreek Hill showing at rank #27 instead of expected #47

**Root Cause**:
- `search_rank` is popularity/search frequency, NOT fantasy ranking
- No actual fantasy rankings available from Sleeper API

**Solution**:
- Stopped using Sleeper for rankings
- Switched to FantasyPros API for actual fantasy rankings

**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED

## August 8, 2025 (Day 4)

### Issue #6: SUPERFLEX Rankings Not Available
**Severity**: üî¥ Critical  
**Component**: `core/official_fantasypros.py`  
**Discovered**: User reported Tyreek Hill at #33 instead of #47

**Problem**:
- FantasyPros API returning standard rankings, not SUPERFLEX
- QBs severely undervalued (not in top 5)
- Tyreek Hill at #30 instead of #47

**Root Cause**:
- Using wrong position parameter
- Standard 'ALL' position doesn't return SUPERFLEX valuations

**Solution**:
```python
# Use 'OP' (Offensive Player) for SUPERFLEX rankings!
if position == "SUPERFLEX":
    params["position"] = "OP"  # This is the key!
```

**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED

### Issue #7: CrewAI Authentication Failure
**Severity**: üî¥ Critical  
**Component**: `agents/draft_crew.py`  
**Discovered**: When initializing CrewAI with Anthropic

**Problem**:
- 401 authentication errors despite valid API key
- Direct Anthropic API calls working, but CrewAI failing

**Root Cause**:
- litellm wrapper not properly handling api_key parameter
- Environment variable not set before import

**Solution**:
```python
# Set environment variable BEFORE importing CrewAI
import os
os.environ["ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"] = api_key

from crewai import LLM
# Don't pass api_key parameter - causes auth errors!
llm = LLM(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
    temperature=0.7,
    max_tokens=4000
)
```

**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED

### Issue #8: Available Players Not Showing in AI Context
**Severity**: üî¥ Critical  
**Component**: `agents/draft_crew.py`  
**Discovered**: During mock draft testing

**Problem**:
- AI recommendations showing "Loading..." for available players
- Only fetching 30 players, limiting to 15 display

**Root Cause**:
- Insufficient player data being fetched
- Display limit too restrictive

**Solution**:
- Increased fetch from 30 to 100 players
- Display top 30-50 available players
- Added better filtering and logging

**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED

---

### Issue #9: Proactive Recommendations Not Triggering
**Severity**: üü° Medium  
**Component**: `dev_server.py`  
**Discovered**: Mock draft testing

**Problem**:
- Proactive analysis not appearing in UI
- Triggers at 6 and 3 picks before turn not working

**Root Cause**:
- Trigger logic calculation error
- UI not properly displaying proactive section

**Solution**:
- Fixed picks-until calculation
- Corrected UI template to show proactive section
- Added debug logging for trigger points

**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED

---

### Issue #10: 45-Second Response Time
**Severity**: üü° Medium  
**Component**: `agents/draft_crew.py`  
**Discovered**: User feedback during testing

**Problem**:
- AI analysis taking 30-45 seconds
- Too slow for real-time draft decisions

**Root Cause**:
- Fetching too many players (200)
- Verbose task descriptions
- Overly detailed prompts

**Solution**:
- Reduced player fetch to 100
- Streamlined task descriptions
- Simplified KEY RULES from 8 points to 3
- Result: 15-20 second response time

**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED

### Issue #11: Keeper Players Being Recommended
**Severity**: üü° Medium  
**Component**: `agents/draft_crew.py`  
**Discovered**: Darnell Mooney recommended despite being keeper

**Problem**:
- AI recommending players already drafted as keepers
- Keeper metadata not being checked

**Root Cause**:
- Not checking `metadata.is_keeper` field in draft picks

**Solution**:
```python
# Added keeper detection
for pick in draft_picks:
    metadata = pick.get('metadata', {})
    if metadata.get('is_keeper'):
        keeper_count += 1
    # Player marked as drafted regardless of keeper status
```

**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED

### Issue #12: Cross-Platform Player ID Mismatch
**Severity**: üü° Medium  
**Component**: Multiple  
**Discovered**: When mapping FantasyPros to Sleeper players

**Problem**:
- Player IDs don't match between platforms
- Can't directly map FantasyPros rankings to Sleeper draft

**Root Cause**:
- Each platform uses proprietary ID system
- No standard player identifier

**Solution**:
- Created `player_id_mapping.json` with 11,389 players
- Implemented name-based matching with fuzzy logic
- Fallback chain for unmapped players

**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED

---

### Issue #13: 2025 Rookie Data Verification
**Severity**: üü¢ Low  
**Component**: Data validation  
**Discovered**: User requested verification

**Problem**:
- Uncertainty if rankings included 2025 rookies
- Need to verify data freshness

**Root Cause**:
- No explicit date/version in API response

**Solution**:
- Searched for Omarion Hampton (2025 rookie)
- Found at rank #58 (RB, LAC)
- Confirmed 2025 data is current

**Status**: ‚úÖ VERIFIED

**Severity**: üü¢ Low  
**Component**: Project organization  
**Discovered**: Multiple test files accumulated

**Problem**:
- Several test/debug files in root directory
- Duplicate server implementations
- Could be better organized

**Potential Solution**:

## Issue Prevention Measures

### Implemented Safeguards:
1. **Comprehensive error handling** - All API calls wrapped in try/catch
