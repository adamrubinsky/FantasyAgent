**Focus**: Foundation and web interface

**Key Developments**:
- Created comprehensive web UI with modern CSS Grid layout
- Implemented WebSocket-based real-time communication
- Built responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Added connection status indicators and error handling

**Files Created/Modified**:
- `web_app.py` - FastAPI web server with WebSocket support
- `templates/index.html` - Complete web interface
- `static/` directory structure

#### Mid-Day Session: Draft Monitoring & Real-time Updates  
**Time**: Mid-day
**Focus**: Core draft monitoring functionality

**Key Developments**:
- Implemented live draft pick detection with 5-second polling
- Built automatic user turn detection system
- Added pre-computation triggers (3 picks before user's turn)
- Created comprehensive draft status display

**Major Features Added**:
- Recent picks display with player names and teams
- User roster tracking with position-based organization
- Available players list with filtering (QB, RB, WR, TE)
- Automatic alerts when user's turn approaches

#### Afternoon Session: AI Integration & Chat System
**Time**: Mid-afternoon  
**Focus**: Claude AI integration and chat functionality

**Key Developments**:
- Integrated Claude API for real-time draft advice
- Built natural language query system

#### Evening Session: FantasyPros API & Bug Fixes
**Time**: Evening
**Focus**: Official API integration and critical fixes

**Key Developments**:
- Set up official FantasyPros MCP server integration
- Added API key management (.env.local configuration)
- Implemented priority system: Official API â†’ Mock data â†’ AgentCore MCP
- Created comprehensive caching strategy (4-hour TTL for rate limit compliance)

**Critical Bug Fixes**:
1. **Roster ID Assignment Issue**: Fixed draft monitor assigning user to roster 1 instead of actual roster 7
2. **Async Handling Bug**: Corrected `get_available_players()` slicing before await
3. **WebSocket Error Handling**: Added comprehensive error catching and debug logging

**Files Created**:
- `core/official_fantasypros.py` - Official FantasyPros MCP client
- `external/fantasypros-mcp-server/` - Official MCP server setup
- `test_debug.py`, `debug_roster.py`, `test_roster_picks.py` - Debug utilities
