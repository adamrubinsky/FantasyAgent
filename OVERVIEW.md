# Fantasy Football Draft Assistant - Project Overview

## 📋 Project Summary
This is an AI-powered fantasy football draft assistant built to provide real-time recommendations during live drafts. The system is designed to work within the critical 90-second pick window and integrates with multiple fantasy platforms.

**Target Date**: August 14th, 2025 (Sleeper draft)  
**League Type**: SUPERFLEX (QBs are much more valuable!)  
**Development Approach**: AWS Bedrock AgentCore deployment with browser-based UI

## 🎯 Current Status (Day 4 - August 8th, 2025)

### 🎉 **DAY 4 MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH - FILTERING BUG FIXED**
- **✅ CRITICAL BUG RESOLVED**: AI no longer recommends already-drafted players (Josh Allen, Lamar Jackson, Patrick Mahomes)
- **✅ Unified Player Mapping System**: Created comprehensive cross-platform ID mapping (11,389 players)
- **✅ Smart Duplicate Resolution**: Handles players with multiple IDs (e.g., Lamar Jackson: 4881 vs 6994)
- **✅ Cross-Platform Integration**: Sleeper + FantasyPros + Yahoo + ESPN + 8 other platform IDs
- **✅ Robust Filtering**: Both list-based and text-based filtering systems working perfectly
- **✅ Educational Code**: Added detailed natural language comments (user preference)

### ⚠️ **NEW CRITICAL ISSUE DISCOVERED**
- **❌ User Roster Tracking Broken**: AI shows "Your Picks So Far: 0" even after user drafted 2 QBs
- **❌ Context-Blind Recommendations**: AI recommends 3rd QB when user needs RB/WR
- **❌ Draft Pick Attribution**: System tracks other users' picks but not current user's selections
- **Impact**: Recommendations are technically correct but contextually irrelevant

### ✅ **PREVIOUS ACHIEVEMENTS**
- **✅ Live Draft Monitoring**: Successfully connected to real Sleeper draft ID 1259283819983294464
- **✅ Multi-Agent AI System**: 5-agent CrewAI system with Draft Monitor, Data Collector, Analysis, Strategy, and Recommendation agents
- **✅ Live API Integration**: Real-time FantasyPros SUPERFLEX rankings + Sleeper draft data
- **✅ Development Server**: localhost:3000 working with cache-busting and real AI agents

### 🔄 **CURRENT SESSION - FINAL OPTIMIZATIONS**  
- **✅ Documentation**: Updating ACTION_LOG.md, OVERVIEW.md with complete progress
- **🔄 Performance**: Optimizing response time from 50s to <10s without quality loss
- **🔄 Multiple Options**: Implementing 3-player recommendations per request
- **🔄 Proactive Triggers**: Auto-recommendations 5-6 picks before user's turn
- **🔄 Memory Storage**: Committing progress to MCP for context retention

### 🎯 **IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES FOR LIVE DRAFT (6 DAYS)**
1. **Speed Optimization**: Reduce AI response time from 50s to under 10s
2. **Multiple Options**: Provide 3 player recommendations for fallback scenarios  
3. **Proactive System**: Auto-trigger recommendations 5-6 picks before user's turn
4. **Final Testing**: Complete mock draft simulation with optimized system

#### `sleeper_client.py` - Sleeper API Integration
- **Purpose**: Complete interface to Sleeper Fantasy Football API
- **Key Classes**:
  - `SleeperClient` - Main client class with async context manager

  - `get_user()` - Fetches user info by username
  - `get_league_info()` - Gets league settings and metadata
  - `get_draft_picks()` - Retrieves all picks made in draft so far
  - `get_all_players()` - Downloads full NFL player database (~5MB, cached)
  - `get_available_players()` - Filters out drafted players, sorts by rank
- **Special Features**:
  - Automatic caching of player data (refreshes daily)
  - SSL handling for macOS development
  - Comprehensive error handling and logging
  - Position filtering (crucial for SUPERFLEX)
- **No Authentication Required**: Sleeper API is completely public

### `/agents/` - AI Agent Components
Will contain CrewAI agents for draft analysis (Day 4+ implementation).

**Planned Agents**:
- **Data Collector Agent** - Fetches live data from APIs
- **Analysis Agent** - Evaluates player stats and projections  
- **Strategy Agent** - Considers league settings and roster construction
- **Recommendation Agent** - Synthesizes final pick suggestions

### `/core/` - Core Business Logic
Will contain the main draft monitoring and recommendation services.

**Planned Components**:
- **Draft Monitor** - Polls for real-time updates every 3-5 seconds
- **Recommendation Engine** - Combines AI analysis with rankings
- **Pre-computation Engine** - Starts analysis 3 picks before your turn

### `/data/` - Data Storage & Caching
Stores cached API responses and draft state.

**Files Created**:
- `players_cache.json` - Full NFL player database (11,388 players)
- `rankings_cache.json` - FantasyPros rankings (future)
- `draft_state.json` - Current draft state (future)

### `/tests/` - Unit Tests
Will contain pytest unit tests for all components (Day 2+ implementation).

## 🔄 Data Flow Architecture

```
1. Draft Monitoring Loop (every 3-5 seconds):
   Sleeper API → Draft Picks → Available Players → Cache Update

2. Recommendation Generation (when 3 picks away):
   Available Players → AI Agents → Rankings Data → Recommendations

3. User Interaction:
   CLI Commands → Sleeper Client → Formatted Display
```

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation Details

### Async Programming Pattern
All API calls use Python's `asyncio` for non-blocking operations:
```python
async with SleeperClient() as client:
    league = await client.get_league_info()
    players = await client.get_available_players(draft_id, position="QB")
```

### Caching Strategy
- **Player Data**: Cached for 24 hours (rarely changes during season)
- **Draft Picks**: Real-time (checked every 3-5 seconds)
- **Rankings**: 1-hour cache (updates throughout draft day)

### Error Handling Philosophy
- **Graceful Degradation**: Always provide something useful even if APIs fail
- **Comprehensive Logging**: All errors logged for debugging
- **Fallback Data**: Cached rankings as backup during API outages

### SUPERFLEX Awareness
Throughout the codebase, special handling for SUPERFLEX leagues:
- QB rankings are weighted higher
- Position scarcity calculations account for 2 QB slots
- Strategy recommendations emphasize early QB drafting
