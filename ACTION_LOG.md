### **üìã Next Steps (Day 2)**

**Goal**: Draft monitoring and real-time pick tracking

**Planned Actions**:
1. **Build Draft Monitor** - Poll draft every 3-5 seconds for new picks
2. **Real-time Updates** - Detect when picks are made instantly
3. **Draft State Management** - Track current pick number and whose turn
4. **Pre-computation Triggers** - Start analysis when 3 picks away from you
5. **Enhanced CLI** - Add `monitor` command for live draft tracking

**Key Challenges to Solve**:
- Efficient polling without rate limiting
- Detecting pick state changes
- Managing draft state persistence
- Performance optimization for real-time use

---

### **üí° Key Learnings**

1. **SUPERFLEX Changes Everything**: QBs rank 2-4, completely different strategy needed
2. **Caching is Critical**: 5MB player database must be cached for performance
3. **Error Handling Matters**: SSL issues, None values, API failures all needed fixes
4. **Real Data is Different**: Mock data doesn't reveal the real edge cases
5. **Documentation is Essential**: Detailed comments help understand complex logic

---

### **üîß Technical Debt & Future Improvements**

1. **SSL Configuration**: Need proper certificates for production deployment
2. **Rate Limiting**: Implement proper rate limiting for API calls
3. **Error Recovery**: Add retry logic with exponential backoff
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Add timing and performance metrics
5. **Unit Tests**: Build comprehensive test suite for all functions
