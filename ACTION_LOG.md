  - tenacity>=8.2.3 (retry logic for API calls)
  - json-repair==0.25.2 (JSON validation)
  - tiktoken>=0.7.0 (tokenization for Claude)

#### **Action 2: Create Multi-Agent Architecture** ‚è∞ 2:30 PM  
**Goal**: Implement 4-agent system from brainstorming.md
- ‚úÖ Created `/agents/draft_crew.py` with full CrewAI implementation
- ‚úÖ **Agent 1 - Data Collector**: Fetches live draft/player data + rankings
  ```python
  # Specialized role: Gathers real-time FantasyPros rankings and Sleeper data
  # Tools: Live rankings, player projections from MCP server
  # Output: Organized data summary for other agents to use
  ```
- ‚úÖ **Agent 2 - Player Analyst**: Evaluates players based on stats/projections
  ```python  
  # Specialized role: Analyzes performance metrics, injury risks, value opportunities
  # Input: Data from Data Collector agent
  # Output: Detailed player analysis with performance trends
  ```
- ‚úÖ **Agent 3 - Draft Strategist**: Considers league settings and roster construction
  ```python
  # Specialized role: SUPERFLEX strategy, positional scarcity, roster construction
  # Input: Analysis from Player Analyst agent
  # Output: Strategic recommendations based on league format
  ```
- ‚úÖ **Agent 4 - Draft Advisor**: Synthesizes final pick suggestions
  ```python
  # Specialized role: Final decision maker, combines all agent insights
  # Input: All previous agent outputs
  # Output: Clear, actionable draft recommendations
  ```

#### **Action 3: Integrate Live MCP Data** ‚è∞ 3:15 PM

  ```python
  async def get_live_rankings_data(position="ALL", limit=50):
      """Fetches current FantasyPros rankings for agents to use"""
      async with MCPClient() as mcp:
          rankings = await mcp.get_rankings(limit=limit)
          # Format data for agent consumption
          return formatted_rankings
  
  async def get_player_projections_data(player_names):
      """Gets specific player projections from MCP server"""
      async with MCPClient() as mcp:
          projections = await mcp.get_projections(player_names)
          return formatted_projections
  ```
- ‚úÖ Modified task creation to include live data in agent prompts
- ‚úÖ Agents now receive fresh FantasyPros data instead of using training data

#### **Action 4: Update CLI Integration** ‚è∞ 3:45 PM
**Goal**: Replace single AI assistant with CrewAI multi-agent system
- ‚úÖ Modified `main.py` to use `FantasyDraftCrew` instead of `FantasyAIAssistant`
- ‚úÖ Updated all AI commands:
  ```python
  # Ask command: python3 main.py ask "Should I draft Josh Allen?"
  def ai_ask_question(question):
      crew = FantasyDraftCrew(anthropic_api_key=api_key)
      response = await crew.analyze_draft_question(question)
  
  # Compare command: python3 main.py compare "Tee Higgins" "Jayden Reed"  
  def ai_compare_players(player1, player2):
      crew = FantasyDraftCrew(anthropic_api_key=api_key)
      comparison = await crew.compare_players(player1, player2)
  
  # Recommend command: python3 main.py recommend -p 37
  def ai_draft_recommendation(current_pick):
      crew = FantasyDraftCrew(anthropic_api_key=api_key)
      recommendation = await crew.get_draft_recommendation(current_pick)
  ```
- ‚úÖ Added fallback to single AI assistant if CrewAI fails
- ‚úÖ Enhanced CLI output shows agent workflow in real-time

#### **Action 5: Test Multi-Agent System** ‚è∞ 4:15 PM

## üìÖ August 5th, 2025 (Final Update) - Official FantasyPros MCP Integration Discovery

### **üéØ MAJOR DISCOVERY**: Found Official FantasyPros MCP Server
**Status**: ‚è≥ PENDING API KEY  
**Time**: +30 minutes
**Impact**: CRITICAL - Will provide real live FantasyPros data

---

### **Action Log - Official MCP Server Discovery**

#### **Action 1: User Questioned Data Accuracy** ‚è∞ 6:30 PM
**Issue**: User correctly identified that Jayden Higgins (HOU rookie) wasn't being found
- ‚ùå **Root Cause**: Custom MCP server using web scraping, not live API
- ‚ùå **FantasyPros changed to JavaScript rendering** - web scraping broken
- ‚úÖ **Fixed temporary issue**: Updated mock data with correct Jayden Higgins
- üéØ **User insight**: "Why can't we get it using the MCP server?"

#### **Action 2: Architecture Investigation** ‚è∞ 6:45 PM
**Discovery**: Our MCP server was custom-built, not using existing solutions
- üîç **Found reference**: `https://github.com/DynamicEndpoints/fantasy-pros-mcp`
- ‚úÖ **Downloaded official server**: Real FantasyPros API integration
- ‚úÖ **Identified requirements**: FantasyPros API key needed
- üìß **User action**: Emailed FantasyPros for API access

#### **Action 3: Official MCP Server Setup** ‚è∞ 7:00 PM
**Goal**: Prepare infrastructure for real live data integration
- ‚úÖ **Cloned official repository**: `git clone https://github.com/DynamicEndpoints/fantasy-pros-mcp.git`
- ‚úÖ **Installed dependencies**: `npm install` completed successfully
- ‚úÖ **Built TypeScript server**: `npm run build` completed
- ‚úÖ **Analyzed API capabilities**: 
  ```typescript
  // Official FantasyPros API endpoints:
  - get_rankings(sport, position, scoring) // NFL with STD/PPR/HALF
  - get_players(sport, playerId) // Player information
  - get_projections(sport, season, week, position) // Weekly projections
  - get_sport_news(sport, limit, category) // Injury/transaction news
  ```

#### **Action 4: Integration Planning** ‚è∞ 7:15 PM
**Goal**: Plan migration from custom to official MCP server
- ‚úÖ **Identified API structure**: Uses `https://api.fantasypros.com/public/v2`
- ‚úÖ **Environment setup**: Requires `FANTASYPROS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here`
- ‚úÖ **Migration strategy**: Replace custom `fantasypros_mcp.py` with official server
- ‚úÖ **Fallback maintained**: Keep mock data for development/testing

---

### **üéØ Impact Assessment**
**CRITICAL IMPROVEMENT**: Moving from mock/scraped data to professional API
- **Data Accuracy**: Real-time FantasyPros consensus rankings
- **Reliability**: Professional API vs fragile web scraping
- **Features**: Projections, news, player info, multiple scoring formats
- **Maintenance**: Official support vs custom maintenance

### **‚è≥ Waiting For:**
- **FantasyPros API Key**: User emailed for access
- **Once received**: Complete integration with live data
- **Timeline**: API key approval process unknown

### **‚úÖ Lessons Learned**
1. **Always check for existing solutions first** before building custom
2. **Web scraping is fragile** - APIs are more reliable
3. **User testing reveals critical issues** - keep testing with real scenarios
