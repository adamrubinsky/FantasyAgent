Player ID Mapping Generator

This script creates a unified mapping file that cross-references player IDs 
from different fantasy football platforms (Sleeper, FantasyPros, Yahoo, ESPN).

Purpose: Solve the core issue where different platforms use different ID systems,
causing player filtering to fail when trying to exclude already-drafted players.
